These are the 3 coding assignments I worked on during my artificial intelligence class. 
The topics include uninformed and informed searches, constraint satisfication problems, and the resolution principle.

- Assignment 1 - Uninformed and informed searches
In this assigment we were given a pacman game where we had to use the premade instructions to make pacman go through a BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy Best First Search, and A* Search.
We also had to solve problems where pacman had to reach all four corners or all food pellets.
*** Important Note ***
We worked on the files "search.py" and "search.agents.py" where ""*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"" is located.
